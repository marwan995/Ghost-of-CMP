## 🐦 About <a name = "about"></a>
- Ghost of CMP is a project we created in a computer graphics course at <b>Cairo University</b> to implement the concepts we learned using OpenGL.

- As the game is a first-person shooter perspective projection is used instead of orthographic projection.

- The instructions file shows how the project started and what tasks needed to be implemented.

## 📖 Story <a name = "story"></a>
- Atef a normal CMP student who got trapped in the digital realm of his PC while fixing bugs that a malicious virus spread through his PC. A lighting strike hits his PC which thrusts Atef into a digital journey in his motherboard.

- Armed with his trusty weapons, he navigates through a labyrinth of circuits and battles against vicious viruses and rogue components.

- Step into the shoes of Atef while he tries to free his precious PC from the clutches of the killer virus infecting it and get out of the digital realm back to being a normal human being working on his college projects.
